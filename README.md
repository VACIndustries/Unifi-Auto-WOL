Automatically creates Wake-on-LAN switches for all devices discovered by the UniFi integration in Home Assistant.

## Features

- üîÑ **Automatic Discovery**: Creates WoL switches for all UniFi devices with MAC addresses
- üè∑Ô∏è **Name Sync**: Updates switch names when you rename devices in UniFi
- üßπ **Auto Cleanup**: Removes switches for devices no longer in UniFi
- üì± **Real-time Monitoring**: Shows device online/offline status based on UniFi presence
- üéØ **No Duplicates**: One switch per MAC address, regardless of name changes

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant with the [UniFi integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/unifi/) configured
- UniFi devices with Wake-on-LAN capability enabled in BIOS/OS
- Devices must be connected via Ethernet (Wi-Fi WoL is unreliable)

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Ensure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed
2. Go to HACS ‚Üí Integrations
3. Click the three dots in the top right ‚Üí Custom repositories
4. Add this repository URL with category "Integration"
5. Find "UniFi Auto Wake-on-LAN" and click Install
6. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `custom_components/unifi_auto_wol` folder
2. Copy it to your `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Search for "UniFi Auto Wake-on-LAN"
4. Click to add it

The integration will automatically:
- Scan for existing UniFi devices
- Create WoL switches for devices with MAC addresses
- Monitor for new devices and name changes

## Usage

### Wake a Device
- Use the switch in the UI: `switch.wol_device_name`
- Call the service: `switch.turn_on` with entity `switch.wol_device_name`
- In automations:
```yaml
service: switch.turn_on
target:
  entity_id: switch.wol_my_computer
```

### Switch States
- **On**: Device is connected to UniFi (online)
- **Off**: Device is not connected to UniFi (offline/sleeping)

## Enabling Wake-on-LAN on Devices

### Windows
1. Open Device Manager
2. Find your network adapter ‚Üí Properties
3. Power Management tab
4. Enable "Allow this device to wake the computer"
5. Enable "Only allow a magic packet to wake the computer"

### BIOS/UEFI
1. Boot into BIOS/UEFI settings
2. Look for "Wake on LAN", "WOL", or "Power on by PCI-E"
3. Enable the setting
4. Save and exit

### Linux
```bash
sudo ethtool -s eth0 wol g
```

## Troubleshooting

### Switch Not Created
- Verify UniFi integration is working
- Check that device has a MAC address in device tracker attributes
- Check logs for errors: `grep unifi_auto_wol home-assistant.log`

### Wake-on-LAN Not Working
- Ensure device has WoL enabled in BIOS and OS
- Use Ethernet connection (Wi-Fi WoL is unreliable)
- Check if device is on same network segment
- Test manually: `wakeonlan AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`

### Name Not Updating
- Integration updates names automatically when UniFi device names change
- Restart integration if names seem stuck
- Check entity registry for conflicts

## Advanced Usage

### Automation Example
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Wake Computer When I Get Home"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: person.me
        to: "home"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.wol_my_computer
```

### Script Example
```yaml
script:
  wake_all_computers:
    alias: "Wake All Computers"
    sequence:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id:
            - switch.wol_desktop
            - switch.wol_server
            - switch.wol_laptop
```
